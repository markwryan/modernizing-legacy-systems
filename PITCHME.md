Not selling anything

Note:
Not trying to convince anyone this is the only way. If a monolith works for your company, great!

+++

The issues ahead are complicated

Note:
Not feasible to cover everything in 45 minutes, the road ahead is not black and white. It is important to continually reflect and take time to consider options as changes are made.

+++

Continually growing process

Note:
Set the stage and set some expectations. Goal of the talk is not to sell one solution in the best, but to educate around some issues and solutions to the issues.

Moving away from a monolith

why?

Note:
In a perfect world, we shouldn't touch the repo and leave it as is. Lay out why not doing that might be the right choice under certain cirumstances.

+++

issues

Note:
Issues abound -- both from a technical and non-technical perspective.

+++

workarounds

Note:
Talk about how to overcome the issues at hand, both for the technical problems, as well as business and people problems that are involved in the process.

process

Go through some tools and workflows that were helpful

A single project/solution/repository which contains multiple products as well as their shared dependencies.

* structured, automated releases
* separate releases
* moving into the cloud

#### a starting point

* central repository
* no internal dependency management
* git
* ci
* minimal test coverage :(
